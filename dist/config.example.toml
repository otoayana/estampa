# Welcome to estampa! The minimum amount of settings you'll need to
# change to get your server working are:
#
# - host
# - mailbox.*
#
# If you're already hosting a Gemini capsule, please also change your
# TLS settings so they point to your capsule's certificate and private
# key. Otherwise, the server will generate them automatically in its
# corresponding designated path.

[base]
bind = "0.0.0.0:1958"
host = "localhost"
# This will be the location where Estampa stores pretty much all of its
# data. mailboxes, trusted servers, local certificates, etc. Keep this
# directory backed up and safe!
store = "./store/"

[tls]
certificate = "./server.crt"
private_key = "./server.key"

# Mailboxes are defined declaratively. In order to define your mailbox,
# you'll need to define a value within a mailbox.* block. Here's an
# example:
#
# [mailbox.skye]
# enabled = true
# name = "Skylar"
#
# To break down which properties do what:
# - "skye" will be the UID of your mailbox (ex. skye@example.com)
#
# - The "enabled" checks whether your account will be receiving new
#   messages. If you've decided to move mailboxes, are getting a lot of
#   spam, or just want to take a break from Misfin, you can set this
#   option to "false", and messages from other users will be blocked.
#
# - The "name" property will be the fancy name of your mailbox. Set it
#   to your own (pseudo-)name!
